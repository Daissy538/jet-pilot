## Introduction
JET Pilot is an open-source K8s IDE. It was created out of frustration, as all "good-looking" K8s IDEs went commercial. Power-users nowaday resort to tools like `k9s`, which works great, but heavily relies on keyboard input. JET Pilot tries to overcome these usability challenges.

## Features
- **Real-time Logs**: Instantly access logs for active monitoring of Kubernetes workloads.
- **Kubernetes Object Management**: Easily manage Kubernetes objects.
- **Command Palette**: A user-friendly interface with customizable shortcuts for efficient navigation and operation.
