<p align="center">JET Pilot is an open-source K8s IDE. It was created out of frustration, as all "good-looking" K8s IDEs went commercial. Power-users nowaday resort to tools like `k9s`, which works great, but heavily relies on keyboard input. JET Pilot tries to overcome these usability challenges.</p>
